## VSCode, Basic UNIX Commands, and Remote Access on MacOS
---

### 1. Installing VSCode
* Go to the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version corresponding to your computer's operating system. 
* After downloading, the home screen should look similar to this:

![VSCode home screen]()


### 2. Remotely Connecting
* Go to [this website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to look up your CSE 15L username.
* Then, in VSCode, open a terminal and use the command `ssh cs15lsp22xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, with the `xxx` replaced with the letters in your own username.
* Respond `yes` to the prompt asking if you want to continue connecting, and then enter your password.
* Once you are connected, you should see something like this in your terminal: ![Successful Remote Connection]() 


### 3. Trying Some Commands
* Next, you can try running some basic UNIX commands from your VSCode terminal. For example:
    * `cd ~` will change the directory back to your home directory
    * `ls` will list the files in your current directory
    * `ls -a` will list all files, including hidden ones, in your current directory
* Some other commands to try include:
    *  `ls -l`
    *  `ls -t`
    *  `ls -lat`
    *  `ls -l`
    *  `ls -l`
* To log out of the remote server, use Ctrl + D or use the `exit` command
